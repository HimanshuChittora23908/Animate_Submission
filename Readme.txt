III. <==================Approach===============>

A. After hours of brainstorming and implementing 3 ideas we finally liked this idea a lot as depression and anxiety was there in India from the very past and no have become a thing to ponder upon as in Covid Situautions it is increasing at an exonential rate.

B. After finalizing the topic and idea we started working on it as stated below. 
1. Firstly, made room and objects of room in blender.
2. Then took the character rain2.0v from blender cloud.
3. Set up her pose with a pen showing drawing a line.
4. Then made a pose of her sleeping on a bed.
5. Animating both of them gave me frames which I made a video using Adobe premier pro.
6. Next I made a building with the girl on top and adjusted her pose like she is doing a suicide due to depression and anxiety.
7. Next I animated the flower blooming sequence again on blender to give a sort of realistic look.
8. Then made her go back after seeing the flower scene.
9. Next I compiled all the frames I got in Adobe Premiere Pro 
10. Then I moved to After Effects to arrange their sequence and insert some transitions.
11. Also added sound eefcts from various royality free and licenced sources(credits have been mentioned above)
12. Rendered the complete video on Adobe Media Encoder to present to you all.
